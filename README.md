# ImageConverter

## Environment Setup

Before using the converter, you should install the OpenCV development library. On Ubuntu, you can install it with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can use the Image Converter to convert your photos.

1. Clone the ImageConverter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ImageConverter.git
cd ImageConverter
```

2. Build the converter:

```bash
make
```

3. Convert your photos by running the converter with the following command:

```bash
./image_converter input_image.xxx output_image.yyy yyy
```

Replace `input_image.xxx` with the path to your input image and `output_image.yyy` with the desired output image path. The `yyy` at the end specifies the format you want to get.

For example, to convert an image named `input_image.jpg` to `output_image.png`, you would run:

```bash
./image_converter input_image.jpg output_image.png png
```

That's it! You can now use this tool to convert images to your desired format.
